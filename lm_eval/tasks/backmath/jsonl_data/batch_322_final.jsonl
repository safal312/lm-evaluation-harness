Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?\"", "output": " \"Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.Belinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.The positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\"", "source_answer": "24"}
