The sum of the lengths of all diagonals of $ABCDE$ is equal to $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$ ?$\\textbf{(A) }129\\qquad \\textbf{(B) }247\\qquad \\textbf{(C) }353\\qquad \\textbf{(D) }391\\qquad \\textbf{(E) }421\\qquad$\"", "output": " \"Let $a$ denote the length of a diagonal opposite adjacent sides of length $14$ and $3$, $b$ for sides $14$ and $10$, and $c$ for sides $3$ and $10$. Using Ptolemy's Theorem on the five possible quadrilaterals in the configuration, we obtain:\\begin{align} c^2 &= 3a+100 \\\\ c^2 &= 10b+9 \\\\ ab &= 30+14c \\\\ ac &= 3c+140\\\\ bc &= 10c+42 \\end{align}Using equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we obtain:\\[a = \\frac{c^2-100}{3}\\]and\\[b = \\frac{c^2-9}{10}\\]Plugging into equation $(4)$, we find that:\\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-100}{3}c &= 3c + 140\\\\ \\frac{c^3-100c}{3} &= 3c + 140\\\\ c^3-100c &= 9c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}Or similarly into equation $(5)$ to check:\\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-9}{10}c &= 10c+42\\\\ \\frac{c^3-9c}{10} &= 10c + 42\\\\ c^3-9c &= 100c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}$c$, being a length, must be positive, implying that $c=12$. In fact, this is reasonable, since $10+3\\approx 12$ in the pentagon with apparently obtuse angles. Plugging this back into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ we find that $a = \\frac{44}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{135}{10}=\\frac{27}{2}$.We desire $3c+a+b = 3\\cdot 12 + \\frac{44}{3} + \\frac{27}{2} = \\frac{216+88+81}{6}=\\frac{385}{6}$, so it follows that the answer is $385 + 6 = \\boxed{391}$\"", "source_answer": "391"}
