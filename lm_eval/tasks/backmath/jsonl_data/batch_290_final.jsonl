Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is an altitude as well as a median, which is useful for finding lengths, since it means we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. At this point, we can drop additional segments from $E$ and $F$ perpendicular to $BC,$ meeting $BC$ at $G$ and $H,$ respectively: [asy]pair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;A = (0, 8);B = (-6, 0);C = (6, 0);D = (0, 0);E = (3, 4);F = (-3, 4);G = (3, 0);H = (-3, 0);draw(A--B--C--cycle);draw(A--D);draw(B--E);draw(C--F);draw(E--G, dotted);draw(F--H, dotted);draw(D + (-0.4, 0) -- D + (-0.4, 0.4) -- D + (0, 0.4));draw(G + (-0.4, 0) -- G + (-0.4, 0.4) -- G + (0, 0.4));draw(H + (-0.4, 0) -- H + (-0.4, 0.4) -- H + (0, 0.4));label(\"$A$\", A, N);label(\"$B$\", B, SW);label(\"$C$\", C, SE);label(\"$D$\", D, S);label(\"$E$\", E, NE);label(\"$F$\", F, NW);label(\"$G$\", G, S);label(\"$H$\", H, S);[/asy] Since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$. Since $\\triangle BFH \\sim \\triangle BAD$ and $BF = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB$ (since F is the midpoint of AB), we can see that $FH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD = 4$ and $BH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BD = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot BC = 3.$ $HC = BC - BH = 12 - 3 = 9.$To find $CF^2,$ we simply use the Pythagorean Theorem: $CF^2 = FH^2 + HC^2 = 16 + 81 = 97.$ By symmetry, we can see that $BE^2 = 97.$ From before, we have that $AD^2 = 8^2 = 64.$ Our answer is therefore $AD^2 + BE^2 + CF^2 = 64 + 97 + 97 = \\boxed{258}.$\"", "source_answer": "258"}
