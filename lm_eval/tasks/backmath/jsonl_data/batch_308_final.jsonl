Let the point of intersection be $K$. We note that $EBK$ is also a right isosceles triangle with side $2-\\sqrt{2}$ and find it's area to be $3-2\\sqrt{2}$. Now, we notice that $FIK$ is also a right isosceles triangle and find it's area to be $\\frac{1}{2}$$FI^2$. This is also equal to $1+3-2\\sqrt{2}$ or $4-2\\sqrt{2}$. Since we are looking for $FI^2$, we want two times this. That gives $\\boxed{8-4\\sqrt{2}}$.\"", "source_answer": "8-4\\sqrt{2"}
