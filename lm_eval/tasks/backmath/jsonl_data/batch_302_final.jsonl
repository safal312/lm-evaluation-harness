Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \\frac{223}{9}x$. This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$). At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don’t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time. We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.The number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$.
