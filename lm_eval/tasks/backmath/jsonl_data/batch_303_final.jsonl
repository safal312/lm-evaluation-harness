We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.Since the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$. Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.Since we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.Hence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$. Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.Now the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$. Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.Let's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$. Amazingly it fits!Since we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored. Hence $x = 1369/3$.Hence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$.
