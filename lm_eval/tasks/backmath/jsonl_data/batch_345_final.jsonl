We start with the denominator $x^4 - 5x^2 + 4x$. We can factor this as $x(x^3 - 5x + 4)$. Solving $x^3 - 5x + 4 = 0$, we find its roots to be $x = 1, -2, 2$. Therefore, the denominator factors as $x(x-1)(x+2)(x-2)$. The numerator $x^3 - kx^2 + 2x$ can be written as $x(x^2 - kx + 2)$. Setting the numerator equal to zero, we solve for $x$: $x(x^2 - kx + 2) = 0$. This yields $x = 0$ or solving $x^2 - kx + 2 = 0$.Next, we identify the holes in the graph by setting the common factors in the numerator and denominator to zero. If $x = 0$ is a hole, then we must have that the numerator and denominator both have $x$ as a factor. Hence $a = 1$. Vertical asymptotes are found at the roots of the denominator that are not canceled out by the numerator. So $b = 3 - a = 2$ because we have vertical asymptotes at $x = 1, x = -2, x = 2$.To find the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since the degree of the numerator (3) is less than the degree of the denominator (4), we have a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$. Hence $c = 1$. There are no oblique asymptotes since the degree of the numerator is not one less than the degree of the denominator, so $d = 0$.Given the sum $a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 8$, we plug in the values: \\\\\\\\[ 1 + 2(2) + 3(1) + 4(0) = 1 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 8. \\\\\\\\] We find that $k$ must be such that the numerator shares a factor with one of the roots of the denominator, indicating that the numerator should be factored as $x(x-1)(x+2)$.
