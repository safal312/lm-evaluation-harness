Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\\triangle ABC$. The crux of this problem is the following lemma.Lemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.Proof. Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$. Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$. Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.To find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.Let $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.The area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\\frac{102*12}{3}=\\boxed{408}$.\"", "source_answer": "408"}
