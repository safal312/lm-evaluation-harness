Let $a_d$ be the leftmost digit of $n$ in its base $7$ expression, $a_{d-1}$ be the digit that is second from the left, and so forth, so that $a_0$ is the base $7$ units digit of $n$. It follows that $a_d$ is the base $16$ units digit of $n$, and so forth. Converting to base $10$, it follows that $$n = 7^d \\cdot a_d + 7^{d-1} \\cdot a_{d-1} + \\cdots + a_0 = 16^d \\cdot a_0 + 16^{d-1} \\cdot a_1 + \\cdots + a_d.$$Combining the like terms, it follows that $$(16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d = 0.$$For $d \\le 3$, we observe that the powers of $16$ are significantly larger than the powers of $7$. More precisely, since $a_i \\le 6$ for each $i$, then we have the following loose bound from the geometric series formula\\begin{align*}0 &= (16^d - 1)a_0 + (16^{d-1} - 7)a_1 + \\cdots + (1 - 7^d)a_d \\\\&\\ge (16^d - 1) + (1 - 7) \\cdot 6 + \\cdots + (1-7^d) \\cdot 6 \\\\&= 16^d + d - 6 \\cdot \\frac{7^{d+1} - 1}{7 - 1} \\\\&\\ge 16^d - 7^{d+1} \\\\\\end{align*}For $d = 3$, then $16^3 = 4096 > 7^4 = 2401$, and by induction, $16^d > 7^{d+1}$ for all $d \\ge 3$. Thus, $d \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. If $d = 0$, then all values will work, namely $n = 1,2,3,4,5,6$. If $d = 1$, then $$(16 - 1)a_0 + (1-7)a_1 = 15a_0 - 6a_1 = 3(5a_0 - 2a_1) = 0.$$Thus, $5a_0 = 2a_1$, so $5$ divides into $a_1$. As $a_1 \\le 6$, then $a_1 = 0,5$, but the former yields that $n = 0$. Thus, we discard it, giving us the number $n = 52_7 = 5 \\cdot 7 + 2 = 37$.

Then, $51 + 3a_1 = 3(17 + a_1) = 16a_2$, so it follows that $a_2$ is divisible by $3$. Thus, $a_2 = 0,3,6$, but only $a_2 = 6$ is large enough.
