It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.Now, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle.
