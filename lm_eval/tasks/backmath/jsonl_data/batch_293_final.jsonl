It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.Now, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle.

Now that we have two pairs of congruent angles, we know that $\\triangle FEG \\sim \\triangle AEB$ by Angle-Angle Similarity.Because the two triangles are similar, we have that the ratio of the altitudes of $\\triangle FEG$ to $\\triangle AEB$ equals the ratio of the bases. $FG:AB=3:6=1:2$, so the the ratio of the altitude of $\\triangle FEG$ to that of $\\triangle AEB$ is also $1:2$. Thus, the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ must be half of the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$. Since the height of rectangle $ABCD$ is $3$, the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ must be $6$. Now that we know that the base and altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ are both $6$, we know that the area of triangle $AEB$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$base $\\times$ height $= (\\frac{1}{2})(6)(6) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\"", "source_answer": "18"}
