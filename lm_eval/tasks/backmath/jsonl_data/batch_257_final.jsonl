The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\75^\\circ = x\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\"", "source_answer": "45"}
