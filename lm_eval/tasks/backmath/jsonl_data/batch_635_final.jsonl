Next, we must find the smallest multiple of 28 and 6. We can do this in two ways: by listing multiples of 28 until we find one that is a multiple of 6 or by finding what factors of 6 that 28 is missing and multiplying by those factors.Method 1: The multiples of 28 go 28 (not divisible by 6), 56 (not divisible by 6), 84 (which is divisible by 6!)... So the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6 is 84.Method 2: The factors of 6 are 1,2,3, and 6, so we can write 6 as $2\\cdot3$. 28 is divisible by 2 but not by 3, so we must multiply it by 3. We find $28\\cdot3=84$ and 84 is therefore the smallest multiple of 4, 7, and 6.Now we just need to find the time that is 84 minutes after 8:00.
