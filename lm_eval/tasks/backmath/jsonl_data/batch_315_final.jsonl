Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, and $R$ be the length of the radius of $\\omega$. By the Power of a Point Theorem, $MD \\cdot (2R - MD) = AM \\cdot MC = 24^2$ or $0 = MD^2 -2R\\cdot MD 24^2$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AD^2 = MD^2 + AM^2 = MD^2 + 24^2$.Let's compute the circumradius $R$: By the Law of Cosines, $\\cos B = \\frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - CA^2}{2\\cdot AB\\cdot BC} = \\frac{43^2 + 13^2 - 48^2}{2\\cdot43\\cdot13} = -\\frac{11}{43}$. By the Law of Sines, $2R = \\frac{AC}{\\sin B} = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(-\\frac{11}{43}\\right)^2}} = \\frac{86}{\\sqrt 3}$ so $R = \\frac{43}{\\sqrt 3}$.Now we can use this to compute $MD$ and thus $AD$. By the quadratic formula, $MD = \\frac{2R + \\sqrt{4R^2 - 4\\cdot24^2}}{2} = \\frac{43}{\\sqrt 3} + \\frac{11}{\\sqrt3} = 18\\sqrt{3}$. (We only take the positive sign because angle $B$ is obtuse so $\\overline{MD}$ is the longer of the two segments into which the chord $\\overline{AC}$ divides the diameter.) Then $AD^2 = MD^2 + 24^2 = 1548$ so $AD = 6\\sqrt{43}$, and $12 < 6 + \\sqrt{43} < 13$ so the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\"", "source_answer": "12"}
