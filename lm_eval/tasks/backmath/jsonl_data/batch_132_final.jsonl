Since $l$ and $w$ are integers, they must be 7 and 8, which gives us a product of $\\boxed{56}$.Below is proof that we want $l$ and $w$ to be as close as possible.Since $l+w=15$, we have $w=15-l$.  The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(15-l)$.

The axis of symmetry is mid-way between these intercepts, so it is at $x=7.5$, which means the vertex is on the line $x=7.5$.  The parabola goes downward from the vertex both to the left and right, so the highest possible point on the graph that has an integer coordinate for $x$ must have $x=7$ or $x=8$ as the $x$-coordinate.
