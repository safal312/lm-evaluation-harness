After trying values of $a$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $a = 960$. That means $n = 1921$.If $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 1$, then $n+1 \\equiv 1,5 \\pmod{6}$ (to avoid common factors that are factors of 6), so $n \\equiv 0,4 \\pmod{6}$. After trying values of $n$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $n = 120$ (we could also stop searching once $n$ gets below 1921).From the casework, the largest natural number $n$ that makes $(1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots + n^2)\\left[(n+1)^2+(n+2)^2+(n+3)^2+\\cdots + (2n)^2\\right]$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{1921}$.\"", "source_answer": "1921"}

By Vieta's Formulas, $r+s = -b$ and $rs$ = $2008b$.We know that one of the possible values of $b$ is 0 because $x^2$ has integer roots. However, adding or removing 0 does not affect the value of $S$, so we can divide both sides by $-b$. Doing so results in\\begin{align*} \\frac{rs}{r+s} &= -2008 \\\\ rs &= -2008r - 2008s \\\\ rs + 2008r + 2008s &= 0 \\\\ (r+2008)(s+2008) &= 2008^2. \\end{align*}WLOG, let $|a| \\le 2008$ be a factor of $2008^2$, so $r+2008 = a$ and $s+2008 = \\tfrac{2008^2}{a}$.
