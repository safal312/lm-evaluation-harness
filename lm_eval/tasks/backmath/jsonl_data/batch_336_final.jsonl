Triangle $ERS$ is an isosceles triangle with largest angle $120^\\circ$ and a side in common with $\\triangle TRS$, so $ORES$ is partitioned into four congruent triangles, exactly three of which form $\\triangle ORS$. Since the ratio of the area enclosed by the small regular hexagon to the area of $ABCDEF$ is the same as the ratio of the area enclosed by $\\triangle ORS$ to the area enclosed by $ORES$, the ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.
